	abstract = {In this paper, we consider phase-field based fracture propagation in elastic media. The main purpose is the development of a robust and efficient numerical scheme. To enforce crack irreversibility as a constraint, we use a primal-dual active set strategy, which can be identified as a semi-smooth Newton method. The active set iteration is merged with the Newton iteration for solving the fully-coupled nonlinear partial differential equation discretized using finite elements, resulting in a single, rapidly converging nonlinear scheme. It is well known that phase-field models require fine meshes to accurately capture the propagation dynamics of the crack. Because traditional estimators based on adaptive mesh refinement schemes are not appropriate, we develop a predictor-corrector scheme for local mesh adaptivity to reduce the computational cost. This method is both robust and efficient and allows us to treat temporal and spatial refinements and to study the influence of model regularization parameters. Finally, our proposed approach is substantiated with different numerical tests for crack propagation in elastic media and pressurized fracture propagation in homogeneous and heterogeneous media.},

@article{KLINSMANN2015313,
	abstract = {The phase field description for crack growth and fracture is an attractive alternative to numerical methods based on discrete representations of cracks, since the phase field methodology avoids the numerically challenging monitoring of the discontinuities introduced by the crack. In particular, for the simulation of complex crack growth topologies and application to coupled systems, e.g.Â with thermal or electrical fields, the phase field method has shown promise. However, an accurate prediction of the crack growth initiation is mandatory for a reliable simulation of crack trajectories both in terms of load history and the path followed through the material. In this work, we therefore investigate predictions of crack growth derived from the phase field method and compare them with established relations from fracture mechanics. To implement the phase field method for crack growth, a parallelized finite element method computer code using adaptive mesh refinement is developed and implemented. Results from it are presented. For these results, pre-existing cracks are introduced into the finite element model in two ways, including their representation as discrete discontinuities and as heterogeneities in the phase field order parameter.},

	abstract = {In this work, we consider adaptive mesh refinement for a monolithic phase-field description for fractures in brittle materials. Our approach is based on an a posteriori error estimator for the phase-field variational inequality realizing the fracture irreversibility constraint. The key goal is the development of a reliable and efficient residual-type error estimator for the phase-field fracture model in each time-step. Based on this error estimator, error indicators for local mesh adaptivity are extracted. The proposed estimator is based on a technique known for singularly perturbed equations in combination with estimators for variational inequalities. These theoretical developments are used to formulate an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm. For the numerical solution, the fracture irreversibility is imposed using a Lagrange multiplier. The resulting saddle-point system has three unknowns: displacements, phase-field, and a Lagrange multiplier for the crack irreversibility. Several numerical experiments demonstrate our theoretical findings with the newly developed estimators and the corresponding refinement strategy.},
