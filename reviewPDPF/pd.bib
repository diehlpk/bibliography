	abstract = { Peridynamics (PD) is a novel continuum mechanics theory established by Stewart Silling in 2000. The roots of PD can be traced back to the early works of Gabrio Piola according to dell{\rq}Isola et al. PD has been attractive to researchers as it is a non-local formulation in an integral form, unlike the local differential form of classical continuum mechanics. Although the method is still in its infancy, the literature on PD is fairly rich and extensive. The prolific growth in PD applications has led to a tremendous number of contributions in various disciplines. This manuscript aims to provide a concise description of the PD theory together with a review of its major applications and related studies in different fields to date. Moreover, we succinctly highlight some lines of research that are yet to be investigated. },

	abstract = {We establish the a priori convergence rate for finite element approximations of a class of nonlocal nonlinear fracture models. We consider state-based peridynamic models where the force at a material point is due to both the strain between two points and the change in volume inside the domain of the nonlocal interaction. The pairwise interactions between points are mediated by a bond potential of multi-well type while multi-point interactions are associated with the volume change mediated by a hydrostatic strain potential. The hydrostatic potential can either be a quadratic function, delivering a linear force--strain relation, or a multi-well type that can be associated with the material degradation and cavitation. We first show the well-posedness of the peridynamic formulation and that peridynamic evolutions exist in the Sobolev space {\$}{\$}H^2{\$}{\$}H2. We show that the finite element approximations converge to the {\$}{\$}H^2{\$}{\$}H2solutions uniformly as measured in the mean square norm. For linear continuous finite elements, the convergence rate is shown to be {\$}{\$}C{\_}t {\backslash}Delta t + C{\_}s h^2/{\backslash}epsilon ^2{\$}{\$}Ct$\Delta$t+Csh2/\ensuremath{\epsilon}2, where {\$}{\$}{\backslash}epsilon {\$}{\$}\ensuremath{\epsilon}is the size of the horizon, h is the mesh size, and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}Delta t{\$}{\$}$\Delta$tis the size of the time step. The constants {\$}{\$}C{\_}t{\$}{\$}Ctand {\$}{\$}C{\_}s{\$}{\$}Csare independent of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}Delta t{\$}{\$}$\Delta$tand h and may depend on {\$}{\$}{\backslash}epsilon {\$}{\$}\ensuremath{\epsilon}through the norm of the exact solution. We demonstrate the stability of the semi-discrete approximation. The stability of the fully discrete approximation is shown for the linearized peridynamic force. We present numerical simulations with the dynamic crack propagation that support the theoretical convergence rate.},

	abstract = {We propose a computational method for a homogenized peridynamics description of fiber-reinforced composites and we use it to simulate dynamic brittle fracture and damage in these materials. With this model we analyze the dynamic effects induced by different types of dynamic loading on the fracture and damage behavior of unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites. In contrast to the results expected from quasi-static loading, the simulations show that dynamic conditions can lead to co-existence of and transitions between fracture modes; matrix shattering can happen before a splitting crack propagates. We observe matrix--fiber splitting fracture, matrix cracking, and crack migration in the matrix, including crack branching in the matrix similar to what is observed in recent dynamic experiments. The new model works for arbitrary fiber orientation relative to a uniform discretization grid and also works with random discretizations. The peridynamic composite model captures significant differences in the crack propagation behavior when dynamic loadings of different intensities are applied. An interesting result is branching of a splitting crack into two matrix cracks in transversely loaded samples. These cracks branch as in an isotropic material but here they migrate over the ``fiber bonds'', without breaking them. This behavior has been observed in recent experiments. The strong influence that elastic waves have on the matrix damage and crack propagation paths is discussed. No special criteria for splitting mode fracture (Mode II), crack curving, or crack arrest are needed, and yet we obtain all these modes of material failure as a direct result of the peridynamic simulations.},

	annote = {The classical continuum theory is not capable of predicting failure without an external crack growth criteria and treats the interface having zero thickness. Alternatively, a nonlocal continuum theory referred to as peridynamic theory eliminates these shortcomings by utilizing formulation that uses displacements, rather than derivatives of displacements, and including material failure in its constitutive relations through the response functions. This study presents a new response function as part of the peridynamic theory to include thermal loading. Furthermore, an efficient numerical algorithm is presented for solution of peridynamic equations. Solution method relies on the discretization of peridynamic equations at collocation points resulting in a set of ordinary differential equations with respect to time. These differential equations are then integrated using explicit methods. In order to improve numerical efficiency of the computations, spatial partitioning is introduced through uniform grids as arrays of linked lists. Furthermore, the domain of interest is divided into subunits each of which is assigned to a specific processor to utilize parallel processing using OpenMP. In order to obtain the static solutions, the adaptive dynamic relaxation method is developed for the solution of peridynamic equations. Furthermore, an approach to couple peridynamic theory and finite element analysis is introduced to take advantage of their salient features. The regions in which failure is expected are modeled using peridynamics while the remaining regions are modeled utilizing finite element method. Finally, the present solution method is utilized for damage prediction of many problems subjected to mechanical, thermal and buckling loads.},

The viscoelastic material response is represented using the thermodynamically acceptable Prony series approach. It can feature as many Prony terms as required and accounts for viscoelastic spherical and deviatoric components. The model was derived from an equivalence between peridynamic viscoelastic parameters and those appearing in classical continuum mechanics, by equating the free energy densities expressed in both frameworks. The model was simplified to a uni-dimensional expression and implemented to simulate a creep-recovery test. This implementation was finally validated by comparing peridynamic predictions to those predicted from classical continuum mechanics. An exact correspondence between peridynamics and the classical continuum approach was shown when the peridynamic horizon becomes small, meaning peridynamics tends toward classical continuum mechanics. This work provides a clear and direct means to researchers dealing with viscoelastic phenomena to tackle their problem within the peridynamic framework.},

The propagation and decay of waves in a one-dimensional, viscoelastic peridynamic medium is analyzed. Both the elastic and damping terms in the material model are nonlocal. Waves produced by a source with constant amplitude applied at one end of a semi-infinite bar decay exponentially with distance from the source. The model predicts a cutoff frequency that is influenced by the nonlocal parameters. A method for computing the attenuation coefficient explicitly as a function of material properties and source frequency is presented. The theoretical results are compared with direct numerical simulations in the time domain. The relationship between the attenuation coefficient and the group velocity is derived. It is shown that in the limit of long waves (or small peridynamic horizon), Stokes{\rq} law of sound attenuation is recovered. },

	abstract = {This article presents a non-ordinary state-based peridynamic (PD) model for thermo-visco-plasticity that incorporates a micro-inertia driven dynamic flow rule. In addition to the three displacement degrees of freedom, the model assigns, to each particle, an internal degree of freedom, namely, the equivalent plastic strain. The flow rule itself is in the form of an integro-differential micro-force balance, written in terms of appropriate PD states associated with micro-stresses corresponding to the internal degree of freedom. An equation for entropy balance, adapted to the PD setup, is also proposed. Along with the internal energy equivalence, we exploit a notion of equivalence of the local entropy production for the constitutive modelling of the force states. As we also demonstrate, the PD model naturally accounts for the localization residual terms in the local balances for internal energy and entropy, originally conceived of by Edelen and co-workers nearly half a century ago as a source of nonlocal interaction. The model is numerically implemented for the problem of impact between two 4340 steel plates, and the results show that the model provides information on nontrivial effects of micro-inertia on the plastic flow and temperature generation. By incorporating a classical damage model in the PD set-up, we also discuss an extension of the approach for ductile failure, and report on the numerical results against tension test on an A440 steel plate with holes.},

	abstract = {Peridynamics is a nonlocal continuum mechanical theory based on minimal regularity on the deformations. Its key trait is that of replacing local constitutive relations featuring spacial differential operators with integrals over differences of displacement fields over a suitable positive interaction range. The advantage of such perspective is that of directly including nonregular situations, in which discontinuities in the displacement field may occur. In the linearized elastic setting, the mechanical foundation of the theory and its mathematical amenability have been thoroughly analyzed in the last years. We present here the extension of Peridynamics to linearized elastoplasticity. This calls for considering the time evolution of elastic and plastic variables, as the effect of a combination of elastic energy storage and plastic energy dissipation mechanisms. The quasistatic evolution problem is variationally reformulated and solved by time discretization. In addition, by a rigorous evolutive {\$}{\$}{\backslash}Gamma {\$}{\$}$\Gamma$-convergence argument we prove that the nonlocal peridynamic model converges to classic local elastoplasticity as the interaction range goes to zero.},

The fatigue model utilizes standard S-N fatigue data for a lamina along with the critical energy release rate values. The fidelity of this model is established by simulating the tests conducted by the Air Force Research Laboratory under the Tech Scout Project. As part of this project, the AFRL tested open-hole composite laminates made of IM7/977-3 for three different layups under cyclic loads for strength and failure progression. The peridynamic predictions agree with the reduction in stiffness and strength as a function of number of load cycles. Also, the progressive damage predictions capture the general characteristics of the experimentally observed damage patterns.},

	abstract = {Although axisymmetric problems are neither the plane stress nor plane strain problems, they can be solved in the two-dimensional (2-D) domain for convenience. In this paper, a modified axisymmetric ordinary state-based peridynamic model considering the shear deformation for linear elastic solids is proposed. By subtracting the rigid body rotation part from the total deformation, the shear deformation of a bond is considered. The bond force density vector is derived indirectly by equalizing the PD energy density and the classical strain energy density. The fictitious density in adaptive dynamic relaxation (ADR) method is derived. Two new damage criterions based on the maximum stretch/deviatoric strain are proposed. Several axisymmetrically three-dimensional (3-D) numerical examples are performed in the computational domains, where the present numerical results are compared with the existing analytical solutions, the classical finite element numerical results and axisymmetric ordinary state-based peridynamic results. The numerical results demonstrate this proposed method can simulate the initiation and propagation of cracks very well under the axisymmetrical conditions, and it has more accuracy than axisymmetric ordinary state-based peridynamic model.},

The J-integral is chosen as a fracture characterizing parameter which is experimentally determined by considering a multiplying form that; numerically evaluated using a finite element method. The numerical results are compared to the experimental data and a good agreement has been pointed out for the deeply cracked specimen (a/w\ensuremath{\geq}0.5). Below this limit, a significant divergence is observed which is attributed to a lack of accuracy of the experimental data processing.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we consider a generic class of bond-based nonlocal nonlinear potentials and formulate the evolution over suitable function spaces. The peridynamic potential considered in this work is a differentiable version of the original bond-based model introduced in Silling (J Mech Phys Solids 48(1):175--209, 2000). The potential associated with the model has two wells where one well corresponds to linear elastic behavior and the other corresponds to brittle fracture (see Lipton (J Elast 117(1):21--50, 2014; 124(2):143--191, 2016)). The parameters in the potential can be directly related to the elastic tensor and fracture toughness. In this chapter we show that well-posed formulations of the model can be developed over different function spaces. Here we will consider formulations posed over H{\"o}lder spaces and Sobolev spaces. The motivation for the H{\"o}lder space formulation is to show a priori convergence for the discrete finite difference method. The motivation for the Sobolev formulation is to show a priori convergence for the finite element method. In the following chapter we will show that the discrete approximations converge to well-posed evolutions. The associated convergence rates are given explicitly in terms of time step and the size of the spatial mesh.},
