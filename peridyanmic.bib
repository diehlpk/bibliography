In an undeformed state of the body, each material point is identified by its coordinates, $$ {{\mathbf{x}}\_{(k) }} $$ with $$ (k=1,2,{\ldots},\infty ) $$ , and is associated with an incremental volume, $$ {V\_{(k) }} $$ , and a mass density of $$ \rho ({{\mathbf{x}}\_{(k) }}). $$ Each material point can be subjected to prescribed body loads, displacement, or velocity, resulting in motion and deformation. With respect to a Cartesian coordinate system, the material point $$ {{\mathbf{x}}\_{(k) }} $$ experiences displacement, $$ {{\mathbf{u}}\_{(k) }} $$ , and its location is described by the position vector $$ {{\mathbf{y}}\_{(k) }} $$ in the deformed state. The displacement and body load vectors at material point $$ {{\mathbf{x}}\_{(k) }} $$ are represented by $$ \mathbf{u}\_{(k) }({{\mathbf{x}}\_{(k) }},t) $$ and $$ \mathbf{b}\_{(k) }({{\mathbf{x}}\_{(k) }},t) $$ , respectively. The motion of a material point conforms to the Lagrangian description.},

	abstract = {Peridynamics (PD), a non-local generalization of classical continuum mechanics (CCM) allowing for discontinuous displacement fields, provides an attractive framework for the modeling and simulation of fracture mechanics applications. However, PD introduces new model parameters, such as the so-called horizon parameter. The length scale of the horizon is a priori unknown and need to be identified. Moreover, the treatment of the boundary conditions is also problematic due to the non-local nature of PD models. It has thus become crucial to calibrate the new PD parameters and assess the model adequacy based on experimental observations. The objective of the present paper is to review and catalog available experimental setups that have been used to date for the calibration and validation of peridynamics. We have identified and analyzed a total of 39 publications that compare PD-based simulation results with experimental data. In particular, we have systematically reported, whenever possible, either the relative error or the R-squared coefficient. The best correlations were obtained in the case of experiments involving aluminum and steel materials. Experiments based on imaging techniques were also considered. However, images provide large amounts of information and their comparison with simulations is in that case far from trivial. A total of six publications have been identified and summarized that introduce numerical techniques for extracting additional attributes from peridynamics simulations in order to facilitate the comparison against image-based data.},

@misc{1803.07622v1,
	abstract = {  Experimental data availability is a cornerstone for reproducibility in
experimental fracture mechanics, which is crucial to the scientific method.
This short communication focuses on the accessibility and long term
availability of raw experimental data. The corresponding authors of the eleven
most cited papers, related to experimental fracture mechanics, for every year
from 2000 up to 2016, were kindly asked about the availability of the raw
experimental data associated with each publication. For the 187 e-mails sent:
22.46\% resulted in outdated contact information, 57.75\% of the authors did
received our request and did not reply, and 19.79 replied to our request. The
availability of data is generally low with only $11$ available data sets
(5.9\%). The authors identified two main issues for the lacking availability of
raw experimental data. First, the ability to retrieve data is strongly attached
to the the possibility to contact the corresponding author. This study suggests
that institutional e-mail addresses are insufficient means for obtaining
experimental data sets. Second, lack of experimental data is also due that
submission and publication does not require to make the raw experimental data
available. The following solutions are proposed: (1) Requirement of unique
identifiers, like ORCID or ResearcherID, to detach the author(s) from their
institutional e-mail address, (2) Provide DOIs, like Zenodo or Dataverse, to
make raw experimental data citable, and (3) grant providing organizations
should ensure that experimental data by public funded projects is available to
the public.
